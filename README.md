#Command Line Chess in Ruby
*Ruby*
This is a command line game of chess written in Ruby for two players.

##How to run
To run clone the repo and run the command ruby chess.rb inside of the repo.

##Features
It supports most basic features of chess, including:
- Highlights allowable moves, removing the moves that would put or leave the current player in check.
- Pawn promotion.
- Automatic check for checkmate, ending the game and declaring a winner when it occurs.


##Implementation Details

###Pieces use inheritance and mixins to DRY up movement logic.
```Ruby
require_relative "piece.rb"
require_relative "slide.rb"

class Queen < Piece
  include Slide

  def initialize(pos, color, board)
    super(pos, color, board)
    (@icon = 'â™›')
  end


  def possible_moves
    diagonal_moves + orthogonal_moves
  end
end
```

###Legal moves are calculated by duplicating the board and applying the move
To check for legal moves the board is duplicated, the potential move is applied and the new board state is examined for check or checkmate
```Ruby
def new_game_state_check?(start_pos, end_pos, color)
  color == :white ? alt_player = :black : alt_player = :white
  potential_board = self.dup
  potential_board.force_move(start_pos, end_pos)
  !potential_board.check?(alt_player)
end
```
